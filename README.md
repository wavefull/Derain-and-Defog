## Prerequisite
- Python>=3.6
- Pytorch>=4.1.0
- Opencv>=3.1.0

## Dataset
Rain100H: [http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/struct/Projects/joint_rain_removal.html][10]<br>
Rain800: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bw2e6Q0nQQvGbi1xV1Yxd09rY2s][11]

We concatenate the two images(B and L) together as default inputs for training. B is corresponding to background image,L is image whose three channels are corresponding to rain streak ,vapor and transparency respectively.
Moreover, there should be three folders 'train', 'test_real', 'test_syn' in the dataset folder.

|         | PSNR  | SSIM  | inference time(Seconds) |
| :------:| :---: | :---: | :---------------------: | 
| testA   | 18.92 | 0.65  |          0.004          |

All PSNR and SSIM of results are computed by using skimage.measure. Please use this to evaluate your works.

## Train, Show and Test
**Train:**
* Download the dataset(~7.8GB) and unpack it into code folder "../dataset/train". Then, run:

```bash
$ python train.py
```
**Show:**
* Download the test dataset(~455MB) and unpack it into code folder "../dataset/test". Then, run: 

```
$ python show.py
```
**Test:**
* Generate syn_test.txt into code folder. Then, run: 

```
$ python test.py
```
